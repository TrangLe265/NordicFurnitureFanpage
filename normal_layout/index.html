      <p>
        Day Bed 710 models the strength, simplicity, and versatility of Aalto’s L-leg family. The bentwood legs and slatted frame combine to provide a sturdy, lightweight structure that can be moved as necessary.<br/>
        Made of solid birch, the Day Bed 710 invites both sitting and reclining. Beyond the mattress, the day bed can also be accessorised with cushions; both items come with removable covers and are available in a variety of colours and textiles.

    <h2>Kiki Sofa</h2>

         alt="Kiki Sofa by Ilmari Tapiovaara"/>
    
      <p>The Kiki Sofa has a frame made of distinctive oval steel tubing. The upholstery offers clean, smooth-edged contours that provide comfort and support. Compact in size and, like a mannequin, appealing in any colour or fabric, its overall effect is one of memorable simplicity. The collection also includes the Kiki Bench, Lounge Chair, and Low Table.<br/>
      Modular in nature, the pieces in the collection can be combined in any number of configurations, while their compact size means they fit naturally into smaller spaces. Announcing a departure from designer Ilmari Tapiovaara’s earlier work, Kiki employs a clean-cut design idiom.</p>
