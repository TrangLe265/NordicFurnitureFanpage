# Nordic Furniture Fanpage
## Overview âœ¨
This was my first ever attempt at creating a static website. This project was part of the Introduction to Digital Service course.
It was with HTML and pure CSS, no framework used. The idea of the project is for students to get used to basic HTML and CSS. 
It does feature unlicensed photos, so... please dont sue me, and dont distribute anywhere ðŸ˜…
