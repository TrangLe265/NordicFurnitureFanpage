            <h1> About me</h1>
            <h2> Hi, my name is Trang. You can also call me Chloe.</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Hanoi, Viet Nam and moved to Finland when I was 18 to pursue my very own European dream. As years went by, I found myself doing things I thought I would never do, like studying to code. But, I also got to do exactly what I set out to do, which is travelling as much as I can around this lovely continent. I am especially fond of the rocky Mediterranean sea and the Finnish sauna, especially if it is nearby an body of water. </p>

        <p class="displayTextBanner"> Besides the sauna and the sea, I have a special interest in the Nordic design and the Nordic aesthetic. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The minimal Nordic aesthetic is the complete opposite of the traditonal maximalist Asian decor style which I am very much used to seeing growing up. It was a breeze of fresh air to my visual brain.<br/><br/> The photo below is of one of my favorite lamps ever. It is called The Flower Pot lamp, designed by the famouse Danish designer Verner Panton. It first came to my attention on a trip to Stockholm, where I saw it the first time in a cafe. Naturally, I spent the remaining of the trip hunting through all the furniture shops in the city to find the exact lamp in the exact shade.</p>
