                    <h2>HAY</h2>
                    <p>Launched in 2002, Danish brand HAY has spent the past 15 years crafting a huge range of modern, functional pieces. HAY collaborates with a number of established and emerging Nordic designers and studios, which has resulted in an interesting and eclectic range of products. HAY’s homewares are playful yet premium, with a palette that spans pastels and neutrals to brass and silver, with all kinds of textures and patterns in between.</p>

                <h2>MUUTO</h2>
                <p> Muuto’s name comes from the Finnish word, muutos, which means ‘new perspectives’. This is the overarching principle the Scandinavian brand applies to all of their designs. Items such as a simple floor lamp are given a fresh, Nordic interpretation, while one of the brand’s most popular products, DOTS, offers a new perspective on the humble coat hook.</p>

                    <h2>Norman Copenhagen</h2>
                    <p> Part of the beauty of Normann Copenhagen’s products is just how exceptionally simple they are. Browsing their vast catalogue of homewares, you notice how all of their pieces have been totally stripped of embellishments or extraneous details. This leaves clean, beautiful, and functional pieces. The Danish brand truly embodies the characteristics of Scandinavian design.</p>

                    <h2>&Tradition</h2>
                    <p> Danish brand &Tradition reconciles old and new to craft their refined range of Scandinavian homewares. By utilising classic materials but re-thinking the ways that they can be used, the brand has crafted a varied collection of lamps, rugs, vases, and furniture. The use of colour in their designs also lends them a unique edge. </p>
