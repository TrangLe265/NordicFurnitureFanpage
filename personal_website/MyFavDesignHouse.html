                <p class="displayTextBanner"> Artek was founded in 1935 in Helsinki by the young idealists Aino and Alvar Aalto, Maire Gullichsen, and Nils-Gustav Hahl to “sell furniture and promote a modern culture of living by exhibitions and other educational means.” </p>

                <p class="displayTextBanner">The name Artek is a synthesis of "art" and "technology" – concepts central to the international modernist movement that came to prominence in the 1920s.</p>
                <br>
            
            <p>It was Walter Gropius, a key proponent of modernism, who coined the motto ‘art and technology – a new unity.’ Technology was understood to include science and industrial production methods, while the conception of art extended beyond the fine arts to encompass architecture and design. Modernism aimed to achieve a fruitful union of these two spheres. This same aspiration guided the founders of Artek in their naming of the company.</p> 

            <p>The Artek collection consists of furniture, lighting, and accessories designed by Finnish masters and leading international designers. It stands for clarity, functionality, and poetic simplicity.In keeping with the radical spirit of its founders, Artek today remains an innovative player in the world of modern design, developing new products at the intersection of design, architecture, and art.</p>

                <h1 class="founders"> The Founders of Artek</h1>
                <p class="founders">In 1935, four young idealists established a dynamic company with grand ambitions. Not least of these was to market and sell the Aaltos’ furniture, lighting, and textiles, particularly on international markets</p>

                    <br/>

                    <p>Alvar Aalto’s pioneering work, in the spirit of the great architects of the 20th century, was a significant factor in the worldwide proliferation of Nordic design, inspiration to generations of designers, and a core element of Artek’s success.Today, Alvar Aalto is still central to Artek, both in the timeless designs that form a major part of the collection and in the enduring influence of his design legacy. </p>

                    <br/>

                    <p> The architect and designer Aino Aalto played an important part in shaping Artek. In addition to her own independent projects and the collaborations she undertook with her husband, Aalto also served as the company’s first Design Director and, from 1941, its Managing Director. Her leadership of the company’s interior design division, called the Drawing Office, was decisive in determining the company’s aesthetic direction. </p>

                    <br/>

                    <p> An artist in her own right, Maire Gullichsen studied painting in Paris and Helsinki.Gullichsen was an early believer in Aalto’s talent and a firm defender of modernism. She rapidly assimilated the new ideas and began actively promoting modernist art, design, and architecture. Under Gullichsen’s direction, Artek organised many exhibitions by world famous artists such as Picasso, Léger, and Calder, establishing Artek as a gateway for international culture in Finland. </p>

                    <p> An art historian, critic, and writer, Nils-Gustav Hahl played a critical role in the history of Artek. It was Hahl who first brought Maire Gullichsen and the Aaltos together, leading to the founding of the company. A polyglot cosmopolitan with an extensive international network, Hahl was active in art circles and fascinated by new trends in art, technology, and society. Hahl became the first Managing Director of Artek, a position he held until his death in 1941.
